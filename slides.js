    text: `I am Vagoga Mary Salle, founder of the Shalom Initiative. 
Our mission is to foster peace, hope, and sustainable change in communities across Cameroon. 

Through education, empowerment, and compassion, we believe every step toward peace builds a stronger future for us all. 

The Shalom Initiative is more than a project — it is a movement of healing, restoration, and possibility.`,

    title: "Economic Empowerment",
    text: `
Shalom Initiative believes that peace is only possible when people have dignity and economic security. 
Through our economic empowerment projects, we have trained and supported more than 70 young girls and women, 
equipping them with livelihood skills such as tailoring, small-scale trading, and food processing. 
Beyond training, we provided startup capital, enabling them to open small businesses and sustain their families. 

This approach not only reduces poverty but also lowers the risk of gender-based violence, early marriage, 
and youth involvement in armed conflict. Women who once depended entirely on others are now able to provide 
basic needs for their children, send them to school, and even employ other young people. 

In a community affected by crisis, these small businesses represent hope, stability, and a pathway out of dependence. 
By investing in women and youth, Shalom Initiative is addressing root causes of conflict, strengthening social cohesion, 
and contributing to Sustainable Development Goals 1 (No Poverty), 5 (Gender Equality), and 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth).

    title: "Agricultural Empowerment",
    text: `
Agriculture remains the backbone of communities in Kumba and surrounding areas, especially in times of conflict when 
formal employment opportunities are scarce. Shalom Initiative has empowered over 45 youths through training in 
pig and poultry farming. We provided start-up support, farm inputs, and technical guidance. 

These projects create food security, income stability, and most importantly, opportunities for young people who 
might otherwise be vulnerable to recruitment by armed groups. Persons with disabilities were also included, proving 
that agriculture can be inclusive and transformative. Families that once depended on food aid are now raising pigs, 
selling eggs, and reinvesting in their farms. 

Agriculture also strengthens community ties, as youth cooperatives and farmer groups are being formed. 
Through these projects, Shalom contributes to SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), 8 (Decent Work), and 10 (Reduced Inequalities).

    title: "Water, Sanitation & Hygiene (WASH)",
    text: `
Access to clean water and proper sanitation is a human right, yet many communities in the Southwest region lack it. 
During the years of the crisis, Shalom Initiative responded by constructing public toilets, rehabilitating water 
points, and distributing WASH kits that included buckets, soap, water storage containers, sanitary pads, and hygiene materials. 

Beneficiaries from Kwa Kwa, Nchang, Besongabang, and Kumba have testified that these interventions reduced 
water-borne diseases, improved personal hygiene, and relieved women and girls from the daily burden of fetching 
unsafe water from distant streams. The WASH program also created awareness sessions on menstrual hygiene, 
reducing stigma and absenteeism among schoolgirls. 

By investing in WASH, Shalom Initiative is not just improving health but building resilience in crisis-affected 
communities. This directly supports SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation).

    title: "Education",
    text: `
Education has been one of the most disrupted areas during the Anglophone crisis, with repeated lockdowns 
and school closures. Shalom Initiative’s “Learn with a Smile” project ensures that vulnerable children are not left behind. 

We have supported over 50 children with school fees, books, uniforms, and trauma healing sessions, 
helping them return to the classroom with dignity and hope. These children, many of whom had lost parents 
or been displaced, were given a chance to study in safety and regain confidence. 

Education is more than learning to read and write; it is an instrument for peace. 
Children who are educated are less likely to join armed groups, more likely to respect diversity, 
and better prepared to build peaceful communities in the future. 

This project aligns with SDG 4 (Quality Education) and contributes to building a culture of peace, tolerance, and resilience.

    title: "Current Situation in Kumba",
    text: `
Kumba remains deeply affected by the ongoing Anglophone crisis. The people live under constant tension due to insecurity, 
frequent lockdowns, and road blockages. Families are often unable to travel, children are forced to stay at home, 
and businesses struggle to survive under restrictions. 

Fear has become a daily companion. Many households have been displaced, while others endure ghost towns, 
a form of enforced shutdown where people cannot open shops or attend school. 
The crisis has shattered livelihoods, increased poverty, and weakened social trust. 
There is also widespread self-censorship, as freedom of speech is restricted by fear of reprisals. 

Despite these challenges, organizations like Shalom Initiative continue to stand with the people, 
delivering aid, education, and opportunities for empowerment. The resilience of the community is remarkable, 
but the need for peace remains urgent. 

Understanding the current situation is crucial, because it reminds us why the work of grassroots organizations 
is not optional but essential.

    title: "Outlook for the Future",
    text: `
Shalom Initiative believes that peace is a journey. Looking forward, our vision is to build stronger leadership 
within our team and to continue empowering communities despite the crisis. 

Future plans include expanding agricultural cooperatives, scaling up vocational training for women and youth, 
building more sustainable WASH facilities, and ensuring that every child has the chance to learn without fear. 
We aim to design more trauma-healing and peacebuilding programs, focusing on reconciliation and dialogue 
between divided communities. 

We also hope to strengthen partnerships with local and international organizations, 
because building peace requires collaboration. Shalom Initiative is committed to walking alongside communities 
until peace, stability, and dignity are restored. 

Our message is clear: peace is possible, but it requires persistence, solidarity, and continued investment in people. 
Together, we can repair lives and restore hope for a better Cameroon. Thank you.
